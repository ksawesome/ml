# **PHASE 6 — PUBLICATION & COMMUNITY (FULL RESEARCHER-LEVEL BLUEPRINT)**

**Duration:** 8–16 weeks (repeatable every submission cycle)
**Goal:** master the craft of writing, submitting, presenting, and defending research at top-tier ML venues.
You will produce publication-ready manuscripts, navigate review cycles, handle rebuttals strategically, and learn how to present work clearly in posters and talks.

This is the phase where you become a *visible* researcher — someone who not only does work but communicates it at a world-class level.

---

# **PHASE OVERVIEW**

Phase 6 focuses on skills that determine whether high-quality research **gets accepted**, recognized, and adopted.
You already know how to *produce* research (Phase 4) and *specialize in a domain* (Phase 5).
Now you will learn how to:

* write papers that read cleanly and convincingly
* structure mathematical exposition
* master advanced LaTeX (templates, macros, BibTeX automation, figure/table workflows)
* understand the psychology of reviewers
* strategically craft rebuttals and negotiate borderline decisions
* build world-class posters and talks
* participate in workshops and academic communities

This is the phase that transforms you from a “researcher who works” into a “researcher who publishes and is known.”

* Negotiation principles: never contradict a reviewer without offering proof

### **Hands-on Practical Work**

* Rebuttal workshop: respond to 3 sample negative reviews
* Rewrite a weak rebuttal into a strong one
* Prepare controlled experiments to address reviewer complaints

### **Expert-level Details Students Miss**

* The rebuttal is not the place to introduce *new claims*

---

# **WHAT NOT TO SKIP**

* Don’t write papers with missing figures or TODO placeholders.
* Don’t write walls of text; use structural cues, theorem boxes, figure anchors.
* Don’t avoid running extra experiments for rebuttal — it often flips decisions.
* Don’t skip internal review.
* Don’t rely on one Latex template; master multiple.
* Don’t upload sloppy artifacts — reviewers notice instantly.

---

# **PREREQUISITES**

You MUST have completed:

* Phase 4 (Research Skills) — DOE, reproducibility, statistics
* Phase 5 (Specialization) — at least one domain capstone
* Full reproducible pipeline (Git, DVC, MLFlow/W&B)

---

# **FAILURE MODES & FIXES**

### **Failure:** Paper is technically correct but fails to convince reviewers.

**Fix:** strengthen introduction narrative; sharpen contributions; improve figures.

### **Failure:** Reviews misunderstand the method.

**Fix:** add explanatory diagrams and clarifying paragraphs; improve related work framing.

### **Failure:** Rebuttal too defensive.

**Fix:** acknowledge misunderstanding; correct with evidence; avoid new claims.

### **Failure:** Poor poster/talk delivery.

**Fix:** rehearse with timer; simplify slides; emphasize contributions repeatedly.

### **Failure:** Low visibility post-submission.

**Fix:** tweet digestible summaries; publish clean repo; engage community.
