    "\n",
    "##### **Part 2: Geometric Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition $A^\\top r^* = 0$ has a profound geometric meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding $A^\\top r^* = 0$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for any vector $v$:\n",
    "$$A^\\top v = 0 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad v \\in \\operatorname{N}(A^\\top) = \\operatorname{Col}(A)^\\perp.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(The nullspace of $A^\\top$ is the orthogonal complement of the column space of $A$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "$$A^\\top (b - Ax^*) = 0 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad (b - Ax^*) \\in \\operatorname{Col}(A)^\\perp.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "$$\\boxed{r^* = b - Ax^* \\text{ is orthogonal to } \\operatorname{Col}(A)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decomposition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry of least squares can be visualized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$\\operatorname{Col}(A)$:** The subspace spanned by the columns of $A$ (the \"feasible region\").\n",
    "- **$b$:** An arbitrary target vector (typically not in $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$).\n",
    "- **$Ax^*$:** The closest point in $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$ to $b$ (the orthogonal projection of $b$ onto $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$).\n",
    "- **$r^* = b - Ax^*$:** The residual, pointing perpendicular to $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decomposition is:\n",
    "$$b = \\underbrace{Ax^*}_{\\in \\operatorname{Col}(A)} + \\underbrace{r^*}_{\\in \\operatorname{Col}(A)^\\perp}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By D7 (projection error decomposition):\n",
    "$$\\|b\\|^2 = \\|Ax^*\\|^2 + \\|r^*\\|^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Part 3: Verification Using Projection**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify this result using the projection framework from D1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Projection onto $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume $A$ has full column rank. The orthogonal projector onto $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$ is:\n",
    "$$P = A(A^\\top A)^{-1}A^\\top.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection of $b$ onto $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$ is:\n",
    "$$P b = A(A^\\top A)^{-1}A^\\top b.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly $Ax^*$ where $x^* = (A^\\top A)^{-1}A^\\top b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Residual is orthogonal to $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By D1 property 4, for any projection $P$:\n",
    "$$(I - P)b \\in \\operatorname{Col}(A)^\\perp.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual is:\n",
    "$$r^* = b - Ax^* = b - Pb = (I - P)b.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $r^*$ lies in the orthogonal complement of $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$, which means:\n",
    "$$A^\\top r^* = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Part 4: Error Minimization Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does making the residual orthogonal to $\\operatorname{Col}(A)$ minimize the error?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** By the Pythagorean theorem (D7), we can decompose:\n",
    "$$\\|b - Ax\\|^2 = \\|b - Ax^*\\|^2 + \\|(Ax^* - Ax)\\|^2 + 2(b-Ax^*)^\\top(Ax^* - Ax).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For any $x \\neq x^*$, we have $Ax - Ax^* \\neq 0$. If $(b - Ax^*) \\perp \\operatorname{Col}(A)$, then:\n",
    "$$(b - Ax^*)^\\top(Ax - Ax^*) = 0$$\n",
    "because $Ax - Ax^* \\in \\operatorname{Col}(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "$$\\|b - Ax\\|^2 = \\|b - Ax^*\\|^2 + \\|A(x - x^*)\\|^2 > \\|b - Ax^*\\|^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for any $x \\neq x^*$. This proves $x^*$ minimizes the least-squares error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Part 5: Connection to Normal Equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The orthogonality condition $A^\\top r^* = 0$ is equivalent to the normal equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from $A^\\top(b - Ax^*) = 0$:\n",
    "$$A^\\top b - A^\\top A x^* = 0$$\n",
    "$$\\boxed{A^\\top A x^* = A^\\top b}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the fundamental normal equation, which characterizes the least-squares solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The orthogonality of the least-squares residual is the **geometric essence** of least squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\text{The optimal } x^* \\text{ makes the residual } r^* \\text{ orthogonal to the column space of } A.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle connects:\n",
    "- **Optimization:** Setting $\\nabla f = 0$ gives $A^\\top r^* = 0$.\n",
    "- **Geometry:** The residual $r^*$ lies in $\\operatorname{Col}(A)^\\perp$.\n",
    "- **Linear algebra:** The normal equations $A^\\top A x = A^\\top b$.\n",
    "- **Signal processing:** The error is uncorrelated with any component in the model space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is used throughout applied mathematics: in regression, signal processing, machine learning, and the foundations of many numerical algorithms.\n",

    "**Key Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Near-perfect CGS/MGS equivalence across all eps values**: Both algorithms produced **identical orthogonality errors** at each perturbation level, even as condition number reached $2.952 \\times 10^{10}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Orthogonality degradation pattern**:\n",
    "   - At `eps=1e-06` (cond ~ $10^6$): CGS/MGS ort_err ~ $10^{-10}$ (still acceptable)\n",
    "   - At `eps=1e-08` (cond ~ $10^8$): CGS/MGS ort_err ~ $10^{-8}$ (entering warning zone per tolerance `1e-9`)\n",
    "   - At `eps=1e-10` (cond ~ $10^{10}$): CGS/MGS ort_err ~ $10^{-6}$ (significant degradation, **WARNING issued**)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reconstruction error remains stable**: Despite orthogonality degradation, reconstruction errors stayed near machine epsilon ($\\sim 10^{-15}$) across all eps values, indicating the $QR$ factors algebraically recover $A$ but the $Q$ factor loses orthonormality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Runtime invariant to ill-conditioning**: Both algorithms showed similar runtimes regardless of condition number (ranging 4–10 ms), confirming computational complexity is $O(nk^2)$ independent of matrix conditioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No visible CGS vs MGS separation**: Even at `eps=1e-10`, CGS and MGS remained numerically indistinguishable in this test, suggesting both are vulnerable to the same cancellation sources under extreme near-dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **CGS orthogonality warning at eps=1e-10**: When columns become nearly linearly dependent (condition number $> 10^{10}$), both CGS and MGS experience orthogonality loss. However, **the reconstruction error remains valid**, which is a critical distinction:\n",
    "- The factorization $A = QR$ still satisfies $\\|\\|A - QR\\|\\|_F \\approx \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon \\|\\|A\\|\\|)$.\n",
    "- However, $Q^\\top Q \\ne I$, so $Q$ is **not orthonormal** and cannot be reliably used in downstream applications expecting orthonormal columns (e.g., `Q.T @ A` for least-squares).\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Why both CGS and MGS fail at extreme ill-conditioning**: The underlying issue is not the Gram–Schmidt variant but **the ill-posedness of orthogonalization itself** when columns are nearly dependent. Information about the $k$-dimensional subspace spanned by the columns is compressed into a smaller effective dimensionality, and floating-point arithmetic cannot reliably recover true orthogonal bases from nearly-dependent input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For matrices with condition number $> 10^8$**:\n",
    "  - Prefer **Householder QR** (`np.linalg.qr`) or **SVD-based approaches** (more numerically stable).\n",
    "  - If Gram–Schmidt must be used, apply **reorthogonalization** (classical double-pass or iterative refinement).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **For this specific test**: The baseline matrix ($\\varepsilon=\\infty$, no perturbation) had condition number $\\approx 1$ with perfect orthogonality ($\\sim 10^{-15}$), which is well-suited to Gram–Schmidt. The stress test confirms that **even MGS cannot overcome fundamental ill-conditioning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downstream implications**: Always validate orthogonality of computed $Q$ using $\\|\\|Q^\\top Q - I\\|\\|_F$ before using $Q$ in applications sensitive to orthonormality.\n",

    "### Computation 6 — Runtime Comparison (CGS vs MGS vs Householder QR)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** measure and compare runtime scaling of Classical Gram–Schmidt (CGS), Modified Gram–Schmidt (MGS), and a robust baseline Householder QR (`np.linalg.qr`) as we vary matrix width `k`. Use these timings to (1) confirm empirical complexity orders and (2) compare constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protocol / requirements**\n",
    "1. Use `float64` and set a reproducible seed: `np.random.seed(2)` at the top of the cell.\n",
    "2. Test widths: `k_list = [20, 50, 100, 200]`. For each `k`, set `n = 5*k` to keep aspect ratio fixed.\n",
    "3. For each `(n,k)` generate a single matrix `A = np.random.randn(n, k)` and reuse the same `A` across timing repeats for fairness.\n",
    "4. For each method (`classical_gs`, `modified_gs`, `np.linalg.qr`), run the factorization `repeats = 5` times and report the **mean** and **std** wall time (use `time.perf_counter()`).\n",
    "5. Compute and print a concise table: for each `k`, show `n`, cond(A), and mean ± std time for each method.\n",
    "6. Compute a rough empirical scaling exponent by fitting a linear model to `log(mean_time)` vs `log(k)` for each method (`slope` approximates the exponent in `time ∝ k^slope`). Print the slope for each method.\n",
    "7. Save `runtime_results` dict with keys `k`, `n`, `cond`, `times` per method. Use `runtime_results` later for plotting.\n",
    "8. Keep outputs succinct: numeric table and slopes only. No plots in this cell.\n"

    "**Key Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Householder QR is fastest by a large margin**: At $k=200$, Householder (`np.linalg.qr`) runs in **16 ms** compared to CGS at **78 ms** and MGS at **118 ms** — approximately **5–7× faster** than the Gram–Schmidt implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CGS is faster than MGS**: CGS consistently outperforms MGS by ~20–50% across all problem sizes, because MGS performs additional memory writes to update remaining columns at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Empirical scaling is subquadratic in k**: All three methods show scaling around $k^{2.2}$–$k^{2.4}$, which is lower than the theoretical $O(nk^2) = O(k^3)$ expected when $n = 5k$. This suggests:\n",
    "   - Cache effects and vectorized operations reduce effective complexity.\n",
    "   - LAPACK's Householder QR benefits from highly optimized BLAS routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Condition numbers are excellent**: All test matrices have $\\kappa(A) \\approx 2.3$–$2.6$, confirming well-conditioned inputs where all methods are numerically stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Variance is low for MGS and Householder**: Standard deviations are small relative to means, indicating stable timing measurements. CGS shows slightly higher variance, possibly due to cache behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance ranking (for well-conditioned matrices)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🥇 **Householder QR** (`np.linalg.qr`): Fastest + most numerically stable\n",
    "2. 🥈 **Classical GS**: Faster than MGS but less stable for ill-conditioned inputs\n",
    "3. 🥉 **Modified GS**: Slower but more stable than CGS under near-dependency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For production use**: Always prefer **`np.linalg.qr(A, mode='reduced')`** — it is 5–7× faster and uses numerically superior Householder reflections via optimized LAPACK.\n",
    "- **For educational purposes**: CGS and MGS are useful for understanding orthogonalization but should not be used for performance-critical code.\n",
    "- **For streaming/incremental orthogonalization**: MGS is preferred when you cannot access the full matrix at once, despite its runtime overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Saved artifacts**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `runtime_results` list contains the full timing data for all $(k, n)$ combinations for downstream visualization and analysis."
